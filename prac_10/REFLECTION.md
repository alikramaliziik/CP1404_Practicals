CP1404 Practical Reflection
Estimates
How was your estimate accuracy usually?
My estimate accuracy varied. Initially, my estimates were often too optimistic, leading to underestimating the time required. As I progressed, I became more realistic, incorporating buffer time and considering potential challenges, which improved my accuracy.

How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?
My estimate accuracy improved significantly as I gained more experience with practical tasks. By reflecting on past estimates and outcomes, I learned to factor in unforeseen issues and more accurately gauge the time needed for various tasks.

What did you learn from doing these estimates?
I learned the importance of breaking down tasks into smaller components and considering potential obstacles. This practice helped me develop a more accurate understanding of task durations and project management skills.

Code Reviews
What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?
Being reviewed by others taught me the value of feedback in improving code quality. I learned to appreciate constructive criticism and how to use it to refine my code, adhere to best practices, and enhance readability and maintainability.

What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?
Conducting code reviews helped me develop a keen eye for detail and improved my understanding of coding standards and best practices. I learned how to provide actionable feedback and how to identify common mistakes and areas for improvement in code.
