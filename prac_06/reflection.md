#1.What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?
I've become more proactive about breaking down tasks into smaller, manageable parts. This approach has helped me stay organized and focused throughout the practical exercises and assignments. Additionally, I've started leveraging debugging techniques more effectively to troubleshoot and understand code errors, which has improved my learning and problem-solving skills.

#2.What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?
I need to improve my consistency in reviewing concepts regularly outsideof class sessions. Allocating specific time for revisiting previous topics and practicing them independently would reinforce my understanding and retention of the material. Furthermore, I aim to maintain a positive attitude towards challenges, viewing them as opportunities for growth rather than setbacks.

#3.What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?
I've been diligent in participating actively during class discussions and seeking clarification when I encounter difficulties. This engagement has deepened my understanding of concepts and fostered a collaborative learning environment. I also appreciate the practice of exploring practical examples and applying theoretical knowledge in real-world scenarios, which enhances my practical skills.

#4.What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?
I need to minimize the tendency to rush through assignments or practical exercises. Taking the time to plan and structure my solutions more thoughtfully will lead to more robust and efficient code. Additionally, I should avoid procrastination by starting tasks earlier and managing my time more effectively to meet deadlines comfortably.

#5.What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?
I suggest incorporating more interactive coding challenges or group projects that simulate real-world scenarios. These activities would encourage collaborative problem-solving, enhance teamwork skills, and prepare us better for industry practices. Additionally, providing more resources for advanced topics or specialized areas within IT would cater to diverse student interests and career paths.

These reflections aim to guide my growth in the subject and contribute positively to my learning journey in IT.
