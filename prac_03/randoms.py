On line 1, the `random.randint(5, 20)` function generated and printed a random integer between 5 and 20, both inclusive.

The smallest number I could have seen was 5, and the largest was 20.

On line 2, I saw a randomly selected odd number between 3 and 9, inclusive.
The smallest number I could have seen on line 2 was 3, and the largest was 9. No, line 2 could not have produced a 4 because the step parameter is set to 2, so only odd numbers are generated within the specified range.

On line 3, I saw a floating-point number within the range of 2.5 to 5.5.
The smallest number I could have seen on line 3 was 2.5, and the largest was 5.5.

import random

random_number = random.randint(1, 100)
print(random_number)
